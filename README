A small helper application, intended to open Android Market URLs from a browser
(which normally they refuse to do).

Registers to handle urls in the 'marketlauncher:' scheme from the browser.
Checks for URLs of the form 'marketlauncher://details?id=...' or 'marketlauncher://search?q=...' 
and creates an intent with the equivalent 'market:...' URI and calls startActivity on it.

Note that the emulator doesn't have a Market client (typically).
